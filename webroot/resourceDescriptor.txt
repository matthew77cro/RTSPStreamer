# This is a resource descriptor
# It maps resources that server will be serving to the uri paths
#
#
# RESOURCE_UNIQUE_ID	PATH_TO_THE_RESOURCE	URI_MAPPING	FPS
# Columns are separated by tabs ('\t')
#
#
# Example:
# 1000 sample_1080p_60fps.h264	samplefullhd	60
# => video named "sample_1080p_60fps.h264" will be mapped to rtsp://serverIP:port/samplefullhd
#    and resource is a video that needs to be played at 60 fps; id
#	 of this resource is 1000
#
# Also, lines that start with '#' are comments (they will be ignored)
1001	sample_720_60fps.h264	samplehd60	60
1002	sample_1080_60fps.h264	samplefullhd60	60
